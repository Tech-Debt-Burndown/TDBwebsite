#### "When you frame technical debt through the lens of strategy, it actually starts to make a lot more sense" - Jamie Dobson ####

With intros over we ask Jamie about his experience with cloud native transformation. He sees many companies who have made a mess of their cloud migration. They have created a lot of technical debt, which can make it difficult to innovate and can lead to security problems.

Jamie says that the best time to do a do over is when you realize that your cloud migration is not working. However, he acknowledges that this is a difficult decision to make. People often feel like they have invested too much time and money in their current system to change it. However, it is often better to start over than to continue down a path that is not working.

Jamie then talks about how to approach cloud native transformation from a strategic point of view. He says that it is important to understand the company's goals and objectives before making any decisions about cloud migration. Once you understand the company's goals, you can then start to think about how cloud native computing can help you achieve those goals.

Jamie concludes by saying that cloud native computing is a powerful tool that can help companies to innovate and grow. However, it is important to approach cloud native transformation in a strategic way in order to get the most out of it.
