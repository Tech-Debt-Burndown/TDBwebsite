#### "They were told observability would solve their problems, but it didn't, so what the @$^#?" - Charity Majors ####

It’s Memorial Day weekend in the US and Spring Bank Holiday in the UK, so Chris and I have decided to fire up the grills and get away from it all and enjoy the weekend. So we took a break this week. Coming up in the next few weeks we have conversations about ops, toil, build times and observability with [Charity Majors](https://techdebtburndown.com/guest/charity/), and we’ll take a look at both the academic side of things and strategies for tech debt reduction with [Eoin Woods](https://techdebtburndown.com/guest/eoin/)

Then a look with Yosef Lehrman at the Biden Executive Order and what it means for government and private sector organizations, we’ll talk SBOMs with Allan Friedman, and much, much more! 

We hope you’ll join us on these upcoming episodes of Tech Debt Burndown Podcast - have a great weekend.
