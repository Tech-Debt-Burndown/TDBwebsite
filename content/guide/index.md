Thanks for agreeing to be on the Tech Debt Burndown podcast. This page is here
to let you know what to expect from the time we'll spend together recording.

Nick will send out an invite to [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com/), which is the
platform that we use for recording. It's entirely browser based, so you'll need
to provide permission to access you microphone when starting. Zencastr also
provides video so that we can see each other whilst recording, but we only use
the audio. This is a podcast not a vodcast.

We'll usually start out with some casual chat, and a quick run through the key
points we're hoping to hit during the recording. For the recording itself we
typically aim for 30-40m in the can to be edited down to about 25m for an episode.	


### Kit ###

We want you to sound great, so it will help a lot if you're somewhere quiet,
on a fixed line to the Internet, with a decent quality mic or headset. It's
also best if you have headphones or earbuds to reduce any possibility of echo. If you're using the microphone on your headphone lanyard, please take care that the mic doesn't get hung up on clothing or facial hair - this causes a staticy noice that is difficult to edit out. 

### Ooops !%$@ ###

If you say anything you're not comfortable with going into the episode just
let us know, and it can be trimmed in the edit.

We generally go for non-explicit content. But if something's worth swearing
about then we can flip that bit.

### Bio, photo and pronouns ###

We create a profile for each guest, which has a bio and 500px square photo.
Often we can find this stuff on the web. But it helps us out (and helps make
sure we're accurate) if you can send us the bio and photo you'd like to use.

Please also let us know your preferred pronouns?
