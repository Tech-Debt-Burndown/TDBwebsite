Eoin Woods has worked in software engineering of some sort for 20 years. He's been lucky enough to work for a number of great companies during that time, including [Groupe Bull](http://www.bull.com/), [Sybase](http://www.sybase.com/), [InterTrust](http://www.intertrust.com/), [Zuhlke](http://www.zuhlke.co.uk/), [BGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock#Barclays_Global_Investors) and [UBS](http://www.ubs.com/). He has also been an independent consultant, which was another good experience.

Today, Eoin is the CTO of [Endava](http://www.endava.com/), the fast growing software engineering services company.  Endava builds software for other people, with most of their projects being in the areas of digital and agile transformation and business and IT automation. Eoin works with Endava's major clients to offer technical advice, particularly around technical strategy, and with Endavaâ€™s delivery organisation to ensure that they have the right people, tools, technologies, and processes in place across to get the job done for their clients.

Eoin is co-author, with Nick Rozanski, of [Software Systemd Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Systems-Architecture-Stakeholders-Perspectives/dp/032171833X/ref=sr_1_1)
