Charity Majors is an operations and database engineer and sometimes engineering manager. “Right now I am the CEO and cofounder of Honeycomb, where we build observability for distributed systems.  (“Monitoring” doesn’t have to be a dirty word; give us a try.)

“Until recently I was a production engineering manager at Facebook.  I spent 3.5 years working on Parse (both pre and post-acquisition by FB).  I also spent several years at Linden Lab, working on the infrastructure and databases that power Second Life.  I am the co-author of [Database Reliability Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Reliability-Engineering-Designing-Operating/dp/1491925949) by O’Reilly.

“I was a classical piano performance major in college, but dropped out because it turns out I prefer not being dirt poor.  I have been building systems and engineering teams ever since.

“I love startups, chaos and hard scaling problems, and somehow I always end up in charge of the databases.”
